# timestamp_link_maker
## Create automatic descriptions with a several timestamp link, of a video composed by the joining of several small videos  

## Usefulness:
This application was developed specifically for video files that were generated from the grouping of several video files.  
For example:  
output video file 1: Created by joining 5 videos  
output video file 2: Created by joining 12 videos  
output video file 3: Created by joining 8 videos  

This scenario would be expressed in a spreadsheet with 25 lines (one for each paternal video), where the column 'file_output' would contain only 3 distinct values.

This file structure is automatically generated by the app [mass_videojoin](https://github.com/apenasrr/mass_videojoin)

The application's goal will be to create a description with timestamps link for each output video file, considering the length of his paternal videos.

Descriptions will be generated in two formats:  
* spreadsheet 'list.xlsx':  
Output video descriptions with timestamp link, folder structure and sequential hashtags  

* text file 'description.txt':  
General description of all output videos, folder structure and sequential hashtags  


## Requirements:  
-- Spreadsheet named 'video_details.xlsx' in same folder as this script  
--- The spreadsheet must have the columns:  
---- 'file_folder': actual file folder  
---- 'file_name': actual file name with extension  
---- 'file_folder_origin': original file folder  
---- 'file_name_origin': original file name with extension  
---- 'file_output': file name of joined video  

To facilitate the readability of the paternal videos in the timestamps, the name of their original folders are used to group the timestamps.

To ensure the correct capture of the name of the original paternal files and folders, the columns 'file_folder_origin' and 'file_name_origin' are required.
If the names of the current files and folders are the same as the original ones, then the column 'file_folder_origin' can be created as a copy of 'file_folder', as well as the column 'file_name_origin' can be created as a copy of 'file_name'.


## How to use  
1. Make sure the spreadsheet 'video_details.xlsx' is in the same folder as the script
2. Execute timestamp_link_maker.py
